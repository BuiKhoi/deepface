Deepface is a lightweight [face recognition](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/) and facial attribute analysis ([age](https://sefiks.com/2019/02/13/apparent-age-and-gender-prediction-in-keras/) and [gender](https://sefiks.com/2019/02/13/apparent-age-and-gender-prediction-in-keras/)) framework for python. It is a hybrid face recognition framework wrapping **state-of-the-art** models: [`VGG-Face`](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/), [`Google FaceNet`](https://sefiks.com/2018/09/03/face-recognition-with-facenet-in-keras/), [`OpenFace`](https://sefiks.com/2019/07/21/face-recognition-with-openface-in-keras/) and [`Facebook DeepFace`](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/17/face-recognition-with-facebook-deepface-in-keras/). Those models already reached and passed the human level accuracy. The library is mainly based on Keras and TensorFlow.
